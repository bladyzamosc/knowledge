### 1. OIDs - object identifiers

- 4-byte integers 
- relation between db objects and the respective OIDs are stored in system catalogs
- pd_database (databases), pg_class (heap tables)

### 2. Layout of cluster

- PG_VERSION - file containing a major version
- pg_hba.conf - client authentication
- pg_ident.conf - user name mapping
- postgresql.conf - configuration parameters
- postgresql.auto.conf - file used for storing configurations paramters are set in ALTER SYSTEM
- postmaster.opts - A file recording the command line options the server was last started with
- under base there are directories with names reflecting OIDs
- each table and index whose size is < 1GB is a single file stored under the database directory is belongs to. --with-segsize can change default 1GB
- OIDs not always match relfilenode (base/15351/12345)
- '_fsm' and '_vm' file suffixes are respectively responsible free space and visibility map (indexes only have free space and no visibility map)

### 3. Tablespace

- Storing tables and indexes on different disks or file systems to distribute the load and improve performance
- Storing large tables or indexes on disks with a different performance profile, such as faster disks for frequently accessed data
- Storing tables and indexes belonging to different users in separate tablespaces to manage disk space usage
- default tablespace can be changed in postgresql.conf file

### 4. Pages (blocks)

- default 8192 bytes (8KB)
- numbered from 0 = block numbers
- An empty space between the end of line pointers and the beginning of the newest tuple is referred to as free space or hole
- Page layout
  - header data - 24 bytes
    - pd_lsn - 8 bytes, stores LSN of XLOG written by last change of this page, related to WAL
    - pd_checksum - (9.3 > version)
    - pd_lower, pd_upper - end of line pointers, beginning of the newest heap tuple
    - pd_special - for indexed, in page within tables it points to the end of the page. In the page within indexes, it points to the beginning of special space which is the data area held only by indexes and contains the particular data according to the kind of index types such as B-tree, GiST, GiN, etc.
  - heap tuple - record data
  - line pointer - 4 bytes, holds a pointer to heap tuple, indexing tuples, offset number
- TID - tuple identifier, block number + offset number - used by index

### 5. Writing and reading tuples

- writing - pd_lower is increased and pd_upper
- B-tree index scan 
  - index file contains index tuples which composed of index key and TID and TID composes block number and offet


### 6. Indexes
